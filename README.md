## Overview and Problem Statement:
Peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending) has proliferated in recent years thanks to Fintech and big data advancements. However, P2P lending platforms are not tightly governed by relevant laws yet, as their development speed has far exceeded that of regulations. Therefore, P2P lending operations are still subject to risks.

## Goal:
To develop a multiclass classifier model which classifies the ‘loan_status_description’ as 'COMPLETED', 'CHARGEOFF', 'CURRENT', 'DEFAULTED'.
